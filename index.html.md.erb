This topic describes what Tanzu <%= vars.ops_manager %> is, how to use it, and how to navigate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> documentation.


## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

A <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment includes both your chosen runtime and the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard. The <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard is the dashboard for administering the runtimes and services within your <%= vars.platform_name %> deployment.

The BOSH Director, deployed as part of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation, controls VM creation and deployment,
as well as other software and service lifecycle events. <%= vars.ops_manager %> includes the BOSH Director tile used to configure BOSH Director.

Example runtimes and services managed though <%= vars.ops_manager %> include, but are not limited to, <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>).

## <a id="ops-man-ui"></a> <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI

The Ops Manager UI is a web application that you use to deploy and manage an <%= vars.platform_name %> PaaS deployment.
This is a guide to deploying and using Ops Manager.

## <a id='ops-man-api'></a> <%= vars.ops_manager %> API

Use the Ops Manager API, `om` CLI, and Platform Automation Toolkit tasks to manage <%= vars.platform_name %> installations programmatically, from the command line, or from an automation pipeline.

See the [Using Ops Manager Programmatically and from the Command Line](./install/ops-man-api-cli.html) topic to learn how to get started using these Ops Manager tools.
