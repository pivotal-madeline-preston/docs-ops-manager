This topic provides an overview of how to install and configure <%= vars.ops_manager %> and app runtimes.

## <a id="overview"></a> About <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation

<%= vars.ops_manager %> installation is a process that involves choosing an IaaS, building the infrastructure, deploying <%= vars.ops_manager %> with a VM image, configuring <%= vars.ops_manager %> settings, and installing runtimes and services on <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

The <%= vars.ops_manager %> installation process takes place in the following parts:

- **Prepare Your <%= vars.ops_manager %> Deployment:** To prepare your deployment, you must create the required components within your IaaS, which can include load balancers, blobstores, databases, TCP routers, DNS records, and more.

- **Deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %>:** To deploy <%= vars.ops_manager %>, you must download <%= vars.ops_manager %> from <%= vars.product_network %>, create a VM image, create a VM instance, and configure the VM instance to run <%= vars.ops_manager %>. 

- **Configure <%= vars.ops_manager %>:** To configure <%= vars.ops_manager %>, you must log into the <%= vars.ops_manager %> interface and configure settings.

- **Install Runtimes:** To install runtime tiles, download them from <%= vars.product_network %> and follow that runtime's procedure to configure and deploy the tile.

- **Install Services:** To install service tiles, download them from <%= vars.product_network %> and follow that service tile's procedure to configure and deploy the tile.

After you successfully install and configure <%= vars.ops_manager %>, you can learn about how to run and operate <%= vars.ops_manager %> as an operator. For more information, see [Operator Guide](../opsguide/index.html).

## <a id='sequence'></a> Install <%= vars.ops_manager %>

<%= vars.ops_manager %>, app runtimes, and associated products can run on multiple IaaSes.
Planning and installing <%= vars.ops_manager %> and app runtimes means building layers from the bottom up,
starting with the details of your IaaS and ending with "Day 2"
configurations that you perform on an installed and running deployment.

The typical planning and installation process is:

1. **Plan**
  - Review the requirements for your IaaS:
      - [AWS](./aws.html)
      - [Azure](./azure.html)
      - [GCP](./gcp.html)
      - [OpenStack](./openstack.html)
      - [vSphere](./vsphere.html)
  - See the Reference Architecture for your IaaS.
  - Assess your requirements, including capacity, availability, container support, host OS, resource isolation, and geographical distribution. Discuss with your VMware contact.

1. **Deploy BOSH and <%= vars.ops_manager %>**
  - [BOSH](https://bosh.io) is an open-source tool that lets you run software systems in the cloud.
      - BOSH and its IaaS-specific Cloud Provider Interfaces (CPIs) are what enable <%= vars.platform_name %> to run on multiple IaaSes.
      - See [Deploying with BOSH](#bosh) for a description of how BOSH deploys cloud software.
   - [<%= vars.ops_manager %>](../index.html) is a graphical dashboard that deploys with BOSH. <%= vars.ops_manager %> works with the BOSH Director to manage, configure, and upgrade products such as <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>), <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>), and services and partner products.
      - <%= vars.ops_manager %> represents products as _tiles_ with multiple configuration panes that let you input or select configuration values needed for the product.
      - <%= vars.ops_manager %> generates BOSH manifests containing the user-supplied configuration values, and sends them to the BOSH Director.
   - A single procedure deploys both BOSH and <%= vars.ops_manager %>.

1. (Optional) **Deploy IPsec BOSH Add-on**
  - [IPsec](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/index.html) encrypts IP data to secure network traffic.
  - If IPsec is required for security compliance, deploy it before you install runtimes.
  - IPsec is deployed with BOSH rather than as an <%= vars.ops_manager %> tile.

1. **Install Runtimes**
  - [<%= vars.app_runtime_full %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/operating/configure-pas.html) (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) lets developers develop and manage cloud-native apps and software services.
      - <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> is based on the Cloud Foundry Foundation's open-source Application Runtime (formerly Elastic Runtime) project.
  - [<%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/tkgi/index.html) (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) uses BOSH to run and manage Kubernetes container clusters.
      - <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> is based on the Cloud Foundry Foundation's open-source Container Runtime (formerly Kubo) project.
  - [<%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/operating/installing-pcf-is.html) lets a single <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> deployment run apps from separate, isolated pools of computing, routing, and logging resources.
      - Operators replicate and configure an <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %> tile for each new resource pool they want to create.
      - You must install <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> before you can install <%= vars.segment_runtime_full %>.
  - [<%= vars.windows_runtime_full %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service-windows/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/index.html) (<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>) enables <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> to manage Windows Server 2016 (1709) stemcells hosting .NET apps, and can also be replicated to create multiple isolated resource pools.
      - Operators replicate and configure a <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile for each new resource pool they want to create.
      - You must install <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> before you can install <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>.
  - [Small Footprint <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/<%= vars.current_major_version.sub('.','-') %>/operating/small-footprint.html) is an alternative to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> that uses far fewer VMs than <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> but has limitations.

1. **Day 2 Configurations**
  - Day 2 configurations set up internal operations and external integrations on a running deployment.
      - Examples include front-end configuration, user accounts, logging and monitoring, internal security, and container and stemcell images.

1. **Install Services**
  - Install software services for developers to use in their apps.
      - Services include the databases, caches, and message brokers that stateless cloud apps rely on to save information.
      - Installing and managing software services on <%= vars.platform_name %> is an ongoing process, and is covered in the [<%= vars.platform_name %> Operator Guide](../opsguide/index.html).


## <a id='bosh'></a> Deploying with BOSH

The following describes how you can use BOSH to run software in the cloud:

1. To use BOSH, you create a _manifest_ `.yml` file that specifies your software system's component processes, the VMs they run on, how they communicate, and anything else they need.

1. The BOSH command-line interface (CLI) or API sends the manifest to the _BOSH Director_, BOSH's executive process.

1. The BOSH Director provisions what it needs from the IaaS, _deploys_ your software to run in the cloud, and heals automatically when VMs go down.

1. BOSH CLI and API commands let you control BOSH-managed processes and allocate or release IaaS resources.
